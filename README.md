## URL Shortener

A robust, multi-tenant URL shortening service built with Laravel 11 and SQLite. This application features Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), organization management, and secure URL redirection.


## Core Functionality

- **URL Shortening:** Generates unique 6-character short codes for long URLs.

- **Redirection:** Instant redirection to original destinations with hit tracking.

- **Hit Counter:** Tracks the number of clicks for every shortened link.


## Architecture & Security

- **Multi-Tenancy:** Users and URLs are strictly scoped to specific Companies (Clients).
  

## RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):

- **Super Admin:** System-wide oversight. Can invite Clients but cannot create URLs.

- **Company Admin:** Manages their specific company. Can invite members and create URLs.

- **Team Member:** Can only create and view their own URLs.
